## ODEs
### Solve Ordinary Differential Equations(ODEs) using Numerical methods.

**1. System of Ordinary Differential Equation using Runge-Kutta fourth-order formula(RK4)**\
Solving of First-Order Two Differential Equation Y'(t)=F(t,x,y) and X'(t)=F(t,x,y) IVP(Initial Value Problem)

**2. Third-Order Differential Equation**
using Runge-Kutta fourth-order formula(RK4)
Diff equation Y'''(t)=F(t,y,y',y'') use IVP(Initial Value Problem)

**3.Linear Shooting Method**
To approximate the solution of the boundary value problem (bvp) x '' = p(t) x'(t) + q(t) x(t) + r(t) with x(a) = alpha and x(b) = beta over the interval [a , b], subinterval M by using the Runge-Kutta method of order 4.

**4. Second-order ODE Solver using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF45)**
To solving initial value problem (ivp) second-order Ordinary Differential Equation(ODE) using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg formula (RKF45). This formula got advantages than the RK4 classic, RKF45 have Error Estimation. In this python project, use math parser pymep, so we can input equation at runtime.

**13. ODEs Solver**
First-Order Ordinary Differential Equation (ivp) using Runge-Kutta 4th Order(RK4) method.
To approximate the solution of the initial value problem (ivp) y ' =f(x,y) with y(a)=yo over [a,b] and subinterval M.

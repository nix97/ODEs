**3.Linear Shooting Method**

To approximate the solution of the boundary value problem (bvp) x '' = p(t) x'(t) + q(t) x(t) + r(t) with x(a) = alpha and x(b) = beta over the interval [a , b], subinterval M by using the Runge-Kutta method of order 4.\

**4. Second-order ODE Solver using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF45)**

To solving initial value problem (ivp) second-order Ordinary Differential Equation(ODE) using Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg formula (RKF45). This formula got advantages than the RK4 classic, RKF45 have Error Estimation. In this python project, use math parser pymep, so we can input equation at runtime.
``` python
from pymep.realParser import eval
# e.g. slope g1
var = {"x": x[k], "y": Yk[k], "z":
      Yk_dash[k]}
g1 = h*eval(DiffEquation, var)
```

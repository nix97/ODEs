Notes :

System of Third-Order Ordinary Differential Equations(ODEs) Solver.

-Check formula on file : System3rdOrderODERK4.docx

-We have three equations (x''' =  ; y''' = ; z''' = ), three variable(x,y,z)

-As the result we got x, y, z, x', y', z', x'', y'' , z'' at  t(time), then plot in graph.
 
-Sourcecode available in Lazarus

-build in Lazarus 3.2

-Using component : 
   -Art formula as math expression parser(free version).
   -Chart as graph viewer (built-in).

-Download file : System3rdOrderODEsScLazarus.rar at https://bitbucket.org/nixz97/nix/downloads/ 

-Feel free to use & modify.



-Component included(Art formula on folder formula).  
-How to install Art formula(as math parser) :
  -At menu package.
  -Open package file (load *.lpk) at folder formula\source\aformula.lpk
  -Compile then install


Tips:

-To smaller the exe file size, can use strip *.exe (example: strip proSystemODEs.exe) at console.
-When rebuild project, the *.exe size approx 55 MB, after "strip" become approx 6 MB
